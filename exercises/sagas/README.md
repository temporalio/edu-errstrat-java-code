## Exercise #3: Rollback with the Saga Pattern

During this exercise, you will:

- Orchestrate Activities using a Saga pattern to implement compensating transactions
- Handle failures with rollback logic

Make your changes to the code in the `practice` subdirectory (look for `TODO` 
comments that will guide you to where you should make changes to the code). 
If you need a hint or want to verify your changes, look at the complete version 
in the `solution` subdirectory.

## Setup & Prerequisites

1. In all terminals, change to the `exercises/sagas/practice`
   directory using the following command:
   ```bash
   cd exercises/sagas/practice
   ```
   or, if you're in the GitPod environment:
   ```bash
   ex3
   ```

## Part A: Review your new rollback Activities and custom Error

This Exercise uses the same structure as in the previous Exercises â€” meaning 
that it will fail at the very end on `ProcessCreditCard` if you provide it with 
a bad credit card number.

Three new Activities have been created to demonstrate rollback actions.

* `updateInventory` is a new step that would run normally (whether or not the
Workflow encounters an error). 
* `revertInventory` has also been added as a compensating action for `updateInventory`. 
* `refundCustomer` has been added as a compensating action for `sendBill`.

1. Review these new Activities at the end of the `PizzaActivities.java` and `PizzaActivitiesImpl.java` 
   file. None of them make actual inventory or billing changes, because the intent 
   of this Activity is to show Temporal features, but you should be able to see 
   where you could add functionality here.
2. Close the files.

## Part B: Add your new rollback Activities to your Workflow

Now you will implement a compensating action using Activities in your Temporal
Workflow using the `Saga` object. Unlike other SDKs, the Temporal Java SDK provides
a custom `Saga` class for handling compensations.

1. Open `PizzaWorkflowImpl.java`. 
2. Note that a Saga object, `saga`, has been added at the top of the Workflow
   Definition to keep track of each Activities compensating action. 
3. The `updateInventory` Activity invocation has been added to your Workflow after 
   validating an order, before the `sendBill` Activity is called. The compensating
   action was added to the `compensations` object in the line above. Study this
   and use it for the next step.
4. Locate the invocation for the `processCreditCard` method. Add the appropriate
   compensation to the `saga` object, including the necessary parameters.  
5. Add the following line to the `catch` block that is associated with the 
   `updateInventory` and `processCreditCard` Activities.
   ```java
   saga.compensate();
   ```
5. Compile your code using `mvn clean compile`.


## Part C: Test the Rollback of Your Activities

Now that you've implemented the Saga pattern, it's time to see it in action. You'll
first execute the Workflow successfully, then introduce an error causing a 
rollback. 

1. In one terminal, start the Worker by running:
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="pizzaworkflow.PizzaWorker"
   ```
   or, if you're in the GitPod environment, run:
   ```bash
   ex3w
   ```
2. In another terminal, start the Workflow by executing:
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="pizzaworkflow.Starter"
   ```
   or, if you're in the GitPod environment, run:
   ```bash
   ex3st
   ```
3. The Workflow should complete successfully. Verify its status is **Completed** in
   the Web UI. 
4. Kill the worker using `^C`
5. Open `Starter.java`
6. Locate the following line:
   ```java
   CreditCardInfo cardInfo = new CreditCardInfo("Lisa Anderson", "424242424242424");
   ```
   And delete the last 4 from the end. This will cause the `processCreditCard`
   Activity to fail, triggering a compensation.
7. Compile your code using `mvn clean compile`
8. Restart the Worker by running:
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="pizzaworkflow.PizzaWorker"
   ```
   or, if you're in the GitPod environment, run:
   ```bash
   ex3w
   ```
9. In another terminal, start the Workflow again by executing:
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="pizzaworkflow.Starter"
   ```
   or, if you're in the GitPod environment, run:
   ```bash
   ex3st
   ```
10. A short time after executing, you should see a stack trace appear stating 
   that the Activity failed.
11. Check the Workflow Execution in the Web UI. The Workflow will still be marked
   **Failed**, as the error that was raised in the Activity is re-thrown after the 
   compensation is complete. Locate the following:
   * Where did the Activity Task fail? What was the error message? 
   * Where did the compensations take place?
      * Hint: Look for `Customer Refunded` and `Reverted changes to inventory`.

You have now implemented the Saga pattern using Temporal.

### This is the end of the exercise.
